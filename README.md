# Symbol-Type Graph (STG)

The STG (symbol-type graph) is an ABI representation and this project contains
tools for the creation and comparison of such representations. At present
parsers exist for libabigail's ABI XML (C types only) and BTF. The ABI diff
tool, stgdiff, supports multiple reporting options. This software currently
depends on libabigail for ELF symbol functionality, on libxml2 for XML parsing
and on Linux UAPI headers for BTF types.
